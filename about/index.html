  <!-- Mission statement --> 
  <div class="container">
      
     <p>
      Born from the minds and ethos of the <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/x4kqcltm4vgo63y/Rave%20Ethics.pdf" target="_blank" >Rave Ethics zine</a>, Future Ethics is a women-run music label. We focus on creating community and beauty in dance music by giving platforms to visionaries prepared to fight for a future that is both sonically and ethically progressive. The future we envision is militantly feminist, queer, anti-racist, and anti-capitalist. We honor our dance music forebears, those who grew the genre out of oppressed communities as a form of resistance, and we highlight their fight as the true spirit of this music. </p> <br>

      <p>
        We believe future ethics are embodied in the experimental, the cerebral, the intentional, the radical: sounds and words that break with convention and at times simply break. We hope to bring together and give platforms to artists of different mediums who share our goals and love of electronic music to create and practice Future Ethics in their own terms.
