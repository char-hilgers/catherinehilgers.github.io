Our second zine as Future Ethics is 44 pages of sheer wonder, in the works since early 2020 - with love! It’s available as a combination of PDF and audio-zine (including image descriptions for those with sight impairment), or as a physical zine sent to your mailbox from our <a href="https://futureethics.bandcamp.com/music" target="_blank" >Bandcamp</a>. Copies are generally also available at <a href="https://hopscotch.page/" target="_blank" >Hopscotch Reading Room</a> in Berlin.  

<br>
<br>

The zine features a cover from Catalina Cavelight, photographs from caner teker’s queered Turkish oil wrestling performance, a mind map of ways to get high without alcohol, watercolours by Bee and Catherine, and an extensive interview with DanceSafe’s executive director Mitchell Gomez. Look out for his very trippy response to the question, What do you think raves will be like in 2049? - Spoiler: drug-brewing yeasts (??). In the centrefold, a fashion editorial with Englesia, Faith Alexandra Marie, and DeForrest Brown, Jr. (aka Speaker Music). Asa Seresin - an absolute pro! - wrote a piece on queer nightlife responses to the pandemic called Spiral to Paradise (ahhhhh), and Hannah Pezzack meditates on collage, fire, and Elysia Crampton’s work in an original poem called Twilight. As signatories, we also republish the Antifascist Music Alliance’s open letter calling on Pitchfork, Resident Advisor, and Ostgut (Berghain) to address Vatican Shadow’s links to fascism.

Future Ethics pays all contributors for their work. Thank you 1000 times to all contributors!
