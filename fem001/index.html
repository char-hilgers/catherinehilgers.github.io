Our first release is an eight-track compilation available <a href="https://futureethics.bandcamp.com/releases" target="_blank" >digitally</a> and on a special USB stick with an accompanying zine. We wanted to foster a spirit of collaboration with an unusual compilation-building structure. Artists gradually added to the compilation as it grew: each artist received the existing tracks and was asked to contribute or remix a track from the compilation. This took time, but resulted in a cohesive and beautiful compilation, rich in emotion, ranging from a vintage club rant from tati au miel; disoriented housy jams from Bergsonist, Beta Librae, and Violet; tense experimental compositions from Englesia and Odete; a 139 BPM banger from softcoresoft; to a dancefloor-melting System of a Down edit from Estoc & Bored Lord. It was mastered by Stud1nt.

The zine, downloadable below and as an <a href="https://soundcloud.com/future-ethics/fem001-cicada-songs-audiozine" target="_blank" >audio-zine</a>, features an interview from Discwomanâ€™s Frankie Decaiza Hutchinson, writing on off-Facebook event organizing from Adwoa Afful, a beautiful cover from collage artist Fenna Fiction, and a guide to recognizing opioid overdoses and administering Naloxone from Liz Singh and Sara Martin in Toronto. It also features a comic from Berlin-based artist @juicycomics and a poem from Wafa Ktaech.
